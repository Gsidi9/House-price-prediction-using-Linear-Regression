# House-price-prediction-using-Linear-Regression

The objective of this project is to create a model to predict house prices based on its features. Data is divided into the Train set and Test set. I use the Train set to make the algorithm learn the dataâ€™s behaviour and then check the accuracy of our model on the Test set.
